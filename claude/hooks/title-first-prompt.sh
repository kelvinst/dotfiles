# SessionStart hook (matcher: startup) for the title skill (dot-mrr): a hook
# cannot pick the tracker item or the state, so it only asks the agent to run
# the title skill once the user's first message is in. Resumes, clears and
# compactions do not match, so a running session keeps its title. Terminal
# CLI sessions have no rename tool and skip it: the skill would only print a
# /rename line for the user.

Do it once; later state changes follow the Session title rule in CLAUDE.md."}}'
